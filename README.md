# githubAction-test
A minimum repo to test my Github Action worflow generate a file and be used for my personal website

This is the attempt no. 2 on trying to trigger `push` event to my workflow, with branches explicitly specified

This will still fail, because `get-repoData.yml` is on a different branch than this one, even though I've set the `on.push` to be applied to all branches
