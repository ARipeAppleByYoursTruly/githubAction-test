# githubAction-test
A minimum repo to test my Github Action worflow generate a file and be used for my personal website

Adding a line to trigger a `push` event to GitHub Action workflows, I expect this will not trigger `get-repoData.json` in `for-personal-website` branch, because I encountered this problem in another repo

This `push` event is from `main` branch
